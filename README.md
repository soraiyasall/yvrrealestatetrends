Vancouver is grappling with a housing crisis. According to a recent study made by Point2Homes, a real estate firm, Vancouver ranks the most unaffordable city in North America – challenging cities like Manhattan and San Francisco (Tierney, 2017). The average detached house in Vancouver is $1.831 million (Globe and Mail, 2017).  Exorbitant prices are forcing families to move to the outskirts, resulting in an urban sprawl as more citizens are moving to the periphery. Housing prices are impacting everyone, particularly the younger generation. According to the 2016 Canadian Census, one in three citizens aged 20-34 years old live at home with their parents.  The Vancouver Housing Affordability tool aims to illustrate the city’s residential landscape over the past 10 years using Canadian Census data. It provides two functions: displays housing trends from 2006 to 2016 and calculates how long it would take the average Vancouverite to save in order to pay for the minimum down payment in each neighbourhood (Census Tract), also referred as the housing affordability index. Depending on the user’s variable choice, a choropleth map will be generated.
